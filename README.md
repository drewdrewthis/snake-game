## Synopsis

If you're like me, you loved playing snake on your old Nokia brick. I woke up one morning and decided to build myself one!

This was my opportunity to try a bunch of new technologies, practice my programming chops, and build something that I knew I'd enjoy using for the length of the project.

I continue to work on it and add new features, so be sure to Star and Follow.

- HTML5/CSS3/JS
- LESS
